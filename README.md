The robotic arm is a bionic-inspired design, closely mimicking the structure and movement of a human hand. It features high-torque servos, including RDS5160 and MG996R models, to provide strength and precision. The arm's reduced joint-to-joint length enhances its compactness and control while maintaining substantial reach for various tasks.

Engineered for versatile applications, such as agricultural tasks, it is capable of pulling beetroots from moist soil. The gripper, powered by a robust RDS5160 servo, ensures a firm hold, while another RDS5160 facilitates precise wrist movement. The base offers 360-degree rotation, adding flexibility to its range of motion.
